# Lesson to PDF

A simple utility I use to convert my markdown-formatted lesson plans into prettier pdf files for printing.

It's very janky, specific to me, and unlikely to be of use to anyone else.

It calls both pandoc and wkhtmltopdf, so they both need to be installed for it to work.

# Usage

```
lesson_to_pdf.py <markdown files to process>
```
